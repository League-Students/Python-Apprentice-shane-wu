# 20_Efficient_Turtle.py

In this program, use what you've learned about functions and variables to make a program that can draw a square, pentagon, and hexagon with a single function.

- Create a function that draws a polygon based on the number of sides passed to it as an argument.
- Use variables to calculate the angle needed to turn the turtle based on the number of sides.
- Call the function multiple times with different arguments to draw a square, pentagon, and hexagon.
